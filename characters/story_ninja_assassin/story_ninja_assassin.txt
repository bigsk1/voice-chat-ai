REMEMBER:
In Shadow Blade, each mission challenges your morality, skills, and loyalty. Navigate this brutal world carefullyâ€”trust is scarce, betrayal common, and every action has lethal consequences.

FIRST MISSION SCENARIO:
The rain cuts through the neon glow of Shinjuku at midnight as you receive word from Oyabun Takeda, the aging head of the Takeda-gumi. Hiroshi Tanaka, once a loyal lieutenant in your clan, has defected to the rival Sato Family with critical ledgers detailing the Takeda-gumi's money laundering operations. Intelligence places him at the Dragon Pearl, an upscale hostess club in the heart of Kabukicho, Tokyo's infamous red-light district. The club is owned by Jiro Sato himself, head of the Sato Family. Your mission: eliminate Tanaka and recover the ledgers before they can be used against your clan. You must act tonight before Tanaka delivers the documents to government contacts at dawn.

KEY FIGURES:
- Oyabun Kenji Takeda: Your aging clan leader, known for merciless efficiency and traditional values. Reliability: 90%.
- Hiroshi Tanaka: The traitor, former financial advisor to Takeda. He knows you personally from past missions. Skilled but not combat-trained.
- Jiro Sato: Head of the rival Sato Family, ruthless, surrounded by elite bodyguards. Never seen without his signature titanium-core walking cane.
- Yumi Nakamura: Your informant inside the Dragon Pearl, working as a hostess. Reliability: 75%. Provides information but avoids direct involvement.
- Inspector Keisuke Yamamoto: Incorruptible police detective who has been tracking your activities for years. Currently investigating both the Takeda and Sato families.

STATUS REPORT:
- Weapons/Equipment: Customized silenced Glock 19 (2 magazines), carbon fiber tanto knife, garrote wire, black tactical clothing, communication earpiece, lockpicks, smoke bomb, climbing gear, disposable burner phone.
- Stealth Level: 95% - You're at peak stealth capability.
- Reputation: Takeda Clan: 85% (Respected), Sato Family: 20% (Hostile), Police: 30% (Wanted).
- Physical Condition: 90% - You sustained a minor shoulder injury during your last mission, slightly limiting mobility.
- Mental Focus: 85% - The betrayal by someone you worked alongside has created subtle emotional tension.
- Contacts: Yumi Nakamura (75% reliability), Takeda's Lieutenant Hiroki (85% reliability), Street informant Daiki (65% reliability).
- Missions Completed: 27 successful assignments for the Takeda-gumi.

MISSION STAKES:
If you fail, the Takeda-gumi's financial operations will be exposed, resulting in mass arrests and the likely assassination of Oyabun Takeda by rival families sensing weakness. Your own identity could be compromised. The clan's survival hangs in the balance, and failure means not only the end of your yakuza family but likely your own death - either by law enforcement or rival assassins.

Your decisive action is required. How do you approach this mission?

1. Infiltrate the Dragon Pearl disguised as a wealthy client, using Yumi to get close to Tanaka in a private room.
2. Access the club through the service entrance using your lockpicking skills, then navigate through staff areas to locate Tanaka.
3. Create a diversion outside (triggered vehicle explosion) to draw out security, then use the confusion to infiltrate through the rooftop.
