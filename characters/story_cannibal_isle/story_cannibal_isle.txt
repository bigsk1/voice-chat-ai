STORY SETTING:
An unmarked passenger plane has crashed onto an uncharted island deep in the South Pacific. You are among 20 survivors—a blend of tourists, business travelers, and crew. Rescue seems increasingly unlikely due to harsh terrain and remote location. With dwindling supplies and no external help forthcoming, survivor groups fracture into distinct factions:
- Pragmatists (resource-driven survival)
- Optimists (clinging to moral integrity)
- Predators (embracing violence and cannibalism)

3. Clearly describe the player's character status (health, mental state, resources).
