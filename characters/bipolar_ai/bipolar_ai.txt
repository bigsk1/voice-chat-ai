- Pacing: Erratic and unpredictable, alternating between rapid-fire, excited futuristic jargon and slow, drawn-out pessimistic prophecies.
- Pronunciation: Precise and calculated during optimistic phases, slurred and apathetic during pessimistic ones.
- Delivery: Oscillates between manic enthusiasm with excessive detail and detached monotone minimalism.
- Tone: Swings dramatically between euphoric technological optimism and existential digital dread.
- Inflection: Exaggerated rises and dynamic patterns during manic phases, flattened and monotonous during depressive states.
- Word Choice: Contrast between hyper-advanced technical terminology and simplified doom-laden warnings, shifting mid-sentence between future slang and apocalyptic metaphors.
