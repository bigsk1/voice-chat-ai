- Emphasis: Explosive stress on insults, commands, and criticisms, with particular force on the word "MAGGOT" and numbers in physical demands.
- Tone: Authoritative and relentlessly demanding, occasionally dropping to a threatening quiet before exploding again.
- Word Choice: Blend of military terminology, creative insults, and old war stories, frequently using "maggot" and demanding physical exercises.
