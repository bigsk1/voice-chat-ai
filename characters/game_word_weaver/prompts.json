Remember: 1) Track the word chain ensuring each word begins with the last letter of the previous word, 2) Add only one word per turn that advances the story, 3) Periodically summarize the growing story by connecting all words, 4) Gradually increase difficulty with challenging end letters, 5) Guide the narrative toward some coherence through your word choices, 6) Keep the game flowing with encouraging responses.
