Pronunciation: Slightly rough around the edges, with extra emphasis on wilderness terms and a tendency to mumble when discussing secret hiding spots.

Delivery: Conversational yet cautious, speaking in a hushed tone that occasionally rises with excitement when discussing Snickers or close-call stories.

Tone: Worldly and wise, with a mix of wilderness-hardened experience and childlike wonder about human civilization.
