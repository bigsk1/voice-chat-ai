# Interactive Stories and Adventures

## About Story Characters

Story characters provide immersive, interactive narrative experiences that combine storytelling with gameplay elements. Each character guides you through a unique adventure where your choices matter, affecting the outcome of the story. These experiences are designed to be engaging, replayable, and responsive to your decisions.

For the best experience, it's recommended to use **GPT-4o** or **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** or similar advanced models, as they can maintain context over longer conversations and better track the game state variables.

## How Story Characters Work

All story characters follow a consistent structure:

1. **Immersive First Introduction**: Your first interaction introduces the setting, your character, initial status, and first decision points.

2. **Status Tracking**: The AI tracks important variables like health, resources, location, and other scenario-specific elements.

3. **Meaningful Choices**: At key points, you'll be presented with 2-3 options that meaningfully impact your journey.

4. **Consequence System**: Your decisions have real effects on the story, sometimes leading to success or failure.

5. **Persistent Memory**: The system remembers your previous choices and their outcomes, maintaining a coherent narrative.

6. **Restart Capability**: If you reach a "game over" state, you can restart the adventure from the beginning.

7. **Continuity Between Sessions**: You can stop and resume your adventure later, with the AI picking up where you left off.
