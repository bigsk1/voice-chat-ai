## About Game Characters

Game characters provide engaging, rule-based interactive experiences that transform your conversation into structured gameplay. Each character serves as a game master or host, guiding you through unique challenges, puzzles, or word games with clear objectives and feedback.

For the best experience, it's recommended to use **GPT-4o** or similar advanced models, as they can better track game states, remember complex rules, and maintain consistency throughout gameplay.

## How Game Characters Work

All game characters follow a consistent structure:

1. **Clear Rules Introduction**: Your first interaction explains the game concept, rules, and victory conditions.

2. **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Most games feature alternating turns between you and the AI, creating a structured play experience.

3. **Score or Progress Tracking**: The AI keeps track of your progress, points, or game state throughout the session.

4. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Many games can adjust to your skill level, becoming more challenging as you improve.

5. **Multiple Rounds**: Games are designed to be played multiple times with new content each time.

6. **Helpful Guidance**: If you get stuck, the AI can provide hints or assistance appropriate to the game.

7. **Victory and Defeat Conditions**: Games have clear outcomes that determine success or failure.
