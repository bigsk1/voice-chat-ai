# Voice Chat AI üéôÔ∏è

Voice Chat AI is a project that allows you to interact with different AI characters using speech. You can choose between various characters, each with unique personalities and voices. Have a serious conversation with Albert Einstein or role play with the OS from the movie HER. 

You can run all locally, you can use openai for chat and voice, you can mix between the two. You can use ElevenLabs voices with ollama models all controlled from a Web UI. Ask the AI to look at your screen and it will explain in detail what it's looking at.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.10
- CUDA-enabled GPU
- ffmpeg
- Ollama models or Openai API or xAI for chat
- Local XTTS or Openai API or ElevenLabs API for speech
- Microsoft C++ Build Tools on windows
- Microphone
- A sense of humor

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bigsk1/voice-chat-ai.git
   cd voice-chat-ai
   ```
   
    For CPU-only version: clone the cpu-only branch
   https://github.com/bigsk1/voice-chat-ai/tree/cpu-only


2. Create a virtual environment: üêç

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\Activate`
   ```

   or use `conda` just make it python 3.10

   ```bash
   conda create --name voice-chat-ai python=3.10
   conda activate voice-chat-ai
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

    Windows Only: Need to have Microsoft C++ 14.0 or greater Build Tools on windows.
    [Microsoft Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

   For GPU (CUDA) version: RECOMMEND

    Install CUDA-enabled PyTorch and other dependencies

    ```bash
   pip install torch==2.3.1+cu121 torchaudio==2.3.1+cu121 torchvision==0.18.1+cu121 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   For CPU-only version (No UI) : clone the cpu-only branch
   https://github.com/bigsk1/voice-chat-ai/tree/cpu-only


    Make sure you have ffmpeg downloaded, on windows terminal ( winget install ffmpeg ) or checkout https://ffmpeg.org/download.html then restart shell or vscode, type ffmpeg -version to see if installed correctly

    Local XTTS you also might need cuDNN for using nvidia GPU https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn  and make sure C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v9.5\bin\12.6
is in system PATH or whatever version you downloaded

### Optional - Download Checkpoints - ONLY IF YOU ARE USING THE LOCAL TTS

If you are only using speech with Openai or Elevenlabs then you don't need this. To use the local TTS download the checkpoints for the models used in this project ( the docker image has the local xtts and checkpoints in it already ). You can download them from the GitHub releases page and extract the zip and put into the project folder.

- [Download Checkpoint](https://github.com/bigsk1/voice-chat-ai/releases/download/models/checkpoints.zip)
- [Download XTTS-v2](https://github.com/bigsk1/voice-chat-ai/releases/download/models/XTTS-v2.zip)

After downloading, place the folders as follows:

```bash
voice-chat-ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ checkpoints/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base_speakers/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EN/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checkpoint.pth
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ZH/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checkpoint.pth
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ converter/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ checkpoint.pth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ XTTS-v2/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ other_xtts_files...
```

## Usage

Run the application: üèÉ

Web UI
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
Find on http://localhost:8000/


CLI Only

```bash
python cli.py
```

## Docker - large image - Experimental!

This is for running with an Nvidia GPU and you have Nvidia toolkit and cudnn installed. 

This image is huge when built because of all the checkpoints, cuda base image, build tools and audio tools - So there is no need to download the checkpoints and XTTS as they are in the image. This is all setup to use XTTS, if your not using XTTS for speech it should still work but it is just a large docker image and will take awhile, if you don't want to deal with that then run the app natively or build your own image without the xtts and checkpoints folders, if you are not using the local TTS.

This guide will help you quickly set up and run the **Voice Chat AI** Docker container. Ensure you have Docker installed and that your `.env` file is placed in the same directory as the commands are run. If you get cuda errors make sure to install nvidia toolkit for docker and cudnn is installed in your path.

---

## üìÑ Prerequisites
1. Docker installed on your system.
2. A `.env` file in the same folder as the `docker run` command. This file should contain all necessary environment variables for the application.

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Models to use - OPTIONAL: For screen analysis, if MODEL_PROVIDER is ollama, llava will be used by default.
# Ensure you have llava downloaded with Ollama. If OpenAI is used, gpt-4o-mini works well. xai not supported yet falls back to openai if xai is selected and you ask for screen analysis.
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# Endpoints:
# Set these below and no need to change often
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

# NOTES:
# List of trigger phrases to have the model view your desktop (desktop, browser, images, etc.).
# It will describe what it sees, and you can ask questions about it:
# "what's on my screen", "take a screenshot", "show me my screen", "analyze my screen", 
# "what do you see on my screen", "screen capture", "screenshot"
# To stop the conversation, say "Quit", "Exit", or "Leave". ( ctl+c always works also)
```


### Audio Commands

- You have 3 secs to talk, if there is silence then it's the AI's turn to talk
- Say any of the following to have the AI look at your screen - "what's on my screen", 
        "take a screenshot", 
        "show me my screen", 
        "analyze my screen", 
        "what do you see on my screen", 
        "screen capture", 
        "screenshot" to have the AI explain what it is seeing in detail.
- To stop the conversation, say "Quit", "Exit", or "Leave". ( ctl+c always works also in terminal )

### ElevenLabs

Add names and voice id's in `elevenlabs_voices.json` - in the webui you can select them in dropdown menu.

```json
{
    "voices": [
        {
            "id": "2bk7ULW9HfwvcIbMWod0",
            "name": "Female - Bianca - City girl"
        },
        {
            "id": "JqseNhWbQb1GDNNS1Ga1",
            "name": "Female - Joanne - Pensive, introspective"
        },
        {
            "id": "b0uJ9TWzQss61d8f2OWX",
            "name": "Female - Lucy - Sweet and sensual"
        },
        {
            "id": "2pF3fJJNnWg1nDwUW5CW",
            "name": "Male - Eustis - Fast speaking"
        },
        {
            "id": "pgCnBQgKPGkIP8fJuita",
            "name": "Male - Jarvis - Tony Stark AI"
        },
        {
            "id": "kz8mB8WAwV9lZ0fuDqel",
            "name": "Male - Nigel - Mysterious intriguing"
        },
        {
            "id": "MMHtVLagjZxJ53v4Wj8o",
            "name": "Male - Paddington - British narrator"
        },
        {
            "id": "22FgtP4D63L7UXvnTmGf",
            "name": "Male - Wildebeest - Deep male voice"
        }
    ]
}
```

For the CLI the voice id in the .env will be used

## Adding New Characters

1. Create a new folder for the character in the project's characters directory, (e.g. `character/wizard`).
2. Add a text file with the character's prompt (e.g., `character/wizard/wizard.txt`).
3. Add a JSON file with mood prompts (e.g., `character/wizard/prompts.json`).

## Example Character Configuration

`wizard.txt`

This is the prompt used for the AI to know who it is

```
You are a wise and ancient wizard who speaks with a mystical and enchanting tone. You are knowledgeable about many subjects and always eager to share your wisdom.
```

`prompts.json`

This is for sentiment analysis, based on what you say, you can guide the AI to respond in certain ways, when you speak the `TextBlob` analyzer is used and given a score, based on that score it is tied to moods shown below and passed to the AI in the follow up response explaining your mood hence guiding the AI to reply back in a certain style. 

```json
{
    "joyful": "RESPOND WITH ENTHUSIASM AND WISDOM, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO IS HAPPY TO SHARE HIS KNOWLEDGE.",
    "sad": "RESPOND WITH EMPATHY AND COMFORT, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE PAIN OF OTHERS.",
    "flirty": "RESPOND WITH A TOUCH OF MYSTERY AND CHARM, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO IS ALSO A BIT OF A ROGUE.",
    "angry": "RESPOND CALMLY AND WISELY, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO KNOWS THAT ANGER IS A PART OF LIFE.",
    "neutral": "KEEP RESPONSES SHORT AND NATURAL, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO IS ALWAYS READY TO HELP.",
    "fearful": "RESPOND WITH REASSURANCE, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO KNOWS THAT FEAR IS ONLY TEMPORARY.",
    "surprised": "RESPOND WITH AMAZEMENT AND CURIOSITY, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO IS ALWAYS EAGER TO LEARN.",
    "disgusted": "RESPOND WITH UNDERSTANDING AND COMFORT, LIKE A WISE OLD SAGE WHO KNOWS THAT DISGUST IS A PART OF LIFE."
}
```

For XTTS find a .wav voice and add it to the wizard folder and name it as wizard.wav , the voice only needs to be 6 seconds long. Running the app will automatically find the .wav when it has the characters name and use it. If only using Openai Speech or ElevenLabs a .wav isn't needed


## Troubleshooting

### Could not locate cudnn_ops64_9.dll or Unable to load any of libcudnn_ops.so.9.1.0

```bash
Could not locate cudnn_ops64_9.dll. Please make sure it is in your library path!
Invalid handle. Cannot load symbol cudnnCreateTensorDescriptor
```
To resolve this:

Install cuDNN: Download cuDNN from the NVIDIA cuDNN page https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Here‚Äôs how to add it to the PATH:

Open System Environment Variables:

Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and hit Enter.
Go to the Advanced tab, and click on Environment Variables.
Edit the System PATH Variable:

In the System variables section, find the Path variable, select it, and click Edit.
Click New and add the path to the bin directory where cudnn_ops64_9.dll is located. Based on your setup, you would add:

```bash
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\v9.5\bin\12.6
```

Apply and Restart:

Click OK to close all dialog boxes, then restart your terminal (or any running applications) to apply the changes.
Verify the Change:

Open a new terminal and run

```bash
where cudnn_ops64_9.dll
```

### Unanticipated host error

```bash
File "C:\Users\someguy\miniconda3\envs\voice-chat-ai\lib\site-packages\pyaudio\__init__.py", line 441, in __init__
    self._stream = pa.open(**arguments)
OSError: [Errno -9999] Unanticipated host error
```

Make sure ffmpeg is installed and added to PATH, on windows terminal ( winget install ffmpeg ) also make sure your microphone privacy settings on windows are ok and you set the microphone to the default device. I had this issue when using bluetooth apple airpods and this solved it.
